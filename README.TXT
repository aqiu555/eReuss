******                   DISCLAIMER                  ******

This software is provided "as is", with no explicit or 
implied warranties. None whatsoever. I mean it. I would 
even write all this in caps if only it didn't look so ugly.

The author disclaims any express or implied warranties, 
including, but not limited to, the implied  warranties of 
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. In 
no event shall the author be liable for any direct, 
indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential 
damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of 
substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or 
profits; or business interruption) however caused and on 
any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict 
liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) 
arising in any way out of the use of this software, even 
if advised of the possibility of such damage.

In other words: I'm still working on this, it may be
faulty, so use it at your own risk.
